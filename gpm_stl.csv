Your distant eyes give me the chills
So I pull you close to me, but
Your eyes fly n’ I can’t see
You stop talking
You won't say what's on your mind
You stop talking
Your eyes say that there's nothin' left to find n’

Will you please give me a hand
Somehow to try to understand
If you would just give me a chance
To explain the circumstance
You aim your every word (like)
You saw those things you heard

They're just stories – baby, it’s not me

To be here the way we are…

Can't you see my words aren't lies
There's no one else quite like you
Who makes me smile the way you that you do

Ain’t nothin’ wrong with takin’ a chance
I requested – she accepted another dance
Then we laughed as I put my arms around her back
Right then, I knew she wanted me to ask… 
(Tell me, girl) 
How about another dance?

Your skin feels right to my hands (yeah)

I’m a warm, kind, honest man
If you wanna find out 1st hand…
How about another dance?

Lookin’ back at me, but this time I see

In my room I’d hear ev’ry step

See time's -- present

Seemed like centuries of suffocation

The whole dang thing ended too fast 
I wasn't really done growing' up

Close my eyes – n’ yeah – I can still feel it

Yeah…that’s a Have-To

I walked out to the yard – he wrapped his arms around me
I was leavin’ home – chasin’ my soul
His baby girl was goin’ off on her own
Closed his eyes – oh – knew I had to go__ (he said)

Still, I knew he was with me anyway

Looked ahead - stared at a statue of Jesus (and I)
I wondered if somehow daddy could see us

V1a
So you are careless n’ peerless 
Not afraid of alone n’
You’re so fearless n’ tearless 
Through your whole life you’ve known
You had your own world to fill
You had your own cards to deal
You never knew what was real 
Just out there on your own

V1b 
So you do your best – you guess 
Nothin’ can get in your way
So you are fearless – you hear less 
In the senseless game you play
Off you are on another quest
Always havin’ to pass some test
Always needin’ to be the best
Show ‘em all you can play

Ch1
Fearless –- so fearless
You make your stand
Fearless –- fearless
You’re in command
No one’s ever gonna talk you down
This is your town, it’ll come around
This is your town, it’ll come around
 
V2 
So you are fearless – so fearless
Oh my, how you have grown
Now you are tearless n’ fearless
We see what you have shown (n’)
We can see through your game
I know how to hide your shame
So much less than the name
That’s why you’re all alone
 
Ch2
Fearless –- so fearless
You make your stand
Fearless –- fearless
You’re in command
No one’s ever gonna talk you down
This is your town, it’ll come around
This is your town, it’ll come around

V1 
If you wander the woods at midnight on Halloween
and something moves between the trees - rustling leaves
The ground shakes, and you trip on an old tombstone and 
you'll hear a sound that chills you to the bone! 

Ch1 
When the witches wizards and warlocksall romp
The ghosts and the demons and goblins clomp, clom
How they whirl and twirl all night 
I'm saying it's a frightening sight
When they're doing a dance they call
The Cemetery Stomp! 

V2 
Well the trolls 2-step like they're in a trance.
The ghouls shake like there are spiders in their pants
The vampires play the same song on and on (while)
Zombies try to keep up & sing along.

Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out
It must have been love
Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It was more that I wanted, but I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now

Seekin' answers I still ain't found  
With the same old smiles that frown 
The moment I turn around
Some days it feels like I'm drivin' in mud 
Pedal to the floorboard - I’m still stuck.  
Goin' nowhere - but I know there's
A place that'll lift me up
Where I keep the good years turnin’

You're home's where you're heart is
Where the front porch lights up the darkness
But the key to get inside my soul
Is to get into my car n' just go

Only so much time n’ so much I can do 
Tryin' what I can to turn things around

Feel like an old screen door with some missin' screws 
My hinges hangin’ like they're ‘bout to let loose (but as)

There's some hidden limit that I can't get past 

When I'm out searchin' for some Promised Land

Try to turn when those wheels just won't grab 
So I slow down n’ tell myself, it’s not that bad (as)

If anyone was in some kind'a bind
There was always a helpin' hand to find 
That's what we meant with the word mine
...I remember a time
Back then, we enjoyed doin' chores 
Didn't ever think about lockin' our doors 
Lived with lots 'a lesses n' fewer mores 
We played hard but didn't run up scores
...I remember a time (2X) 
Look at how we live today
Forgettin' all about the word shame 
It's all for money - and money for some
It's not about the game - only who won 
It's try to make the absolute most
No matter whose back is broke 
...I remember a time (3X) 
I was raised by The Great Generation 
Who risked their lives for our great nation

Kickin’ clouds a’ dirt - ‘swingin’ my legs

Somewhere inside -- where my heart hides
I find a reason to go on
It still beats true, through thoughts of you
Some confuse it with bein ’strong

Ch1
No more tears fall - I built some walls
Made me a safe place to hide
Those same fears call, but I mask them all
I keep them somewhere inside
Somewhere inside

V2
I turn my cheek when mem'ries creep
I fight the feelin’ that comes
You broke my heart when I dropped my guard
You had me – then you had to run

Ch2
No more tears fall - I built some walls
Made me a safe place to hide
Those same fears call, but I mask them all
I keep them somewhere inside
Somewhere inside
Somewhere inside

Br
I let my heart go
I was such a fool
So I finally know
Tragedy takes two
In a lonely home
Silence tells me
Feelin ’alone’s
Not feelin' free

Ch3

Saw your tail lights headin’ west
To find a place with a new sunset
I watched you fade into the sky
Did you look back in the rear-view mirror

I wonder, baby, did you even cry

Like she's long since gone to another place
Breathes a real big sigh
Stuffs some papers in her bag 
Tries to walk away with pride 
She steps from court 
Wraps her scarf - as she heads towards the door
Grabbin' her keys, she leaves
She's divorced, now, and she's fin'ly free
But still lookin' for some peace
She done her best
Done what love told her to do
Said vows that turned meaningless - somehow 
As she meets a clear truth
Ev'rythin' seems so cold - so old
She feels so used
Tryin' to start life new 
She slips slowly -- into her car
Turns the key - wantin' to drive forever far
Both hands on the wheel 
Now she can't feel (nothin') 
Ev'rythin's movin', but she sits still

As it did when she sat alone at night
Wishin' a way  to make things right

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me?
Guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,""
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Never will forget that day or that yard
Daddy pushed my bike – my heart was poundin’ hard 
He had taken off those trainin’ wheels
The moment he let go was such a thrill 
Close my eyes – n’ ew – I can still feel it

Years come n’ go without explanation (If I could) 
I’d do it all again without hesitation
The only thing diff’rent I’d have to do, 
Is spend more time with you
Yeah…that’s a Have-To

Finished packin’ as he waited patiently
I walked out to the yard – he wrapped his arms ‘aound me
I was leavin’ home – chasin’ my soul
His baby girl was goin’ off on her own
Closed his eyes – oh – knew I had to go__ (he said)

Daddy didn’t make it to my wedding day
Still, I knew he was with me anyway 
I could feel him as I walked the aisle alone 
Looked ahead - stared at a statue of Jesus (and I)
I wondered if somehow daddy could see us
…That night I placed a flower on his tombstone

Spark these embers - give love a brand-new name

I heard your words but ev’rythin’ ends there

An answer in your eyes – a smile of light

We crumble to the hurt…

Just got lost tryin’ to find you 
In an empty world with so little time 
It’s me-my-mine without any rhyme 
Those silent moments holdin’ you so tight 
There were no words, only warmth n’ sight 
We seem to forget that time is but a treasure 
Till we look back to find its measure

A woman on the radio talks about revolution
When it's already passed her by
Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about
Didn't know it could feel this good to be alive

I was alive and I waited, waited
I was alive and I waited for this
Right here, right now
There is no other place I wanna be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history

I saw the decade end, when it seemed the world could change
At the blink of an eye
And if anything
Then there's your sign of the times

I was alive and I waited, waited
I was alive and I waited for this
Right here, right now

Down by where the water bends

Has its history of mystery - with this town

I coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this girl believin'
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt

Then I heard it on the street
I heard you mighta found somebody new
Well who is she baby - who is she
And tell me what she means to you

I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife
But it feels so right
It cuts like a knife
But it feels so right

There's times I've 'bin mistaken
There's times I thought I'd 'bin misunderstood
So wait a minute darlin'
Can't you see we did the best we could

This wouldn't be the first time
Things have gone astray
Now you've thrown it all away

Now it cuts like a knife
But It feels so right

Frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
Snow on snow,
In the bleak mid-winter
Long ago.
Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him
Nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away
When He comes to reign:
In the bleak mid-winter
A stable-place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty,
Jesus Christ.
Enough for Him, whom cherubim
Worship night and day,
A breastful of milk
And a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, whom angels
Fall down before,
The ox and ass and camel
Which adore.
Angels and archangels
May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air,
But only His mother
In her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the Beloved
With a kiss.
What can I give Him,
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
I would bring a lamb,
If I were a wise man
I would do my part,

Don’t hear nothin’ at all n’ 
Nobody's list'nin'

Starin' at the stars   
Wond'rin where you are

Guess who's the fool who's 
Losin' himself -- after losin' you

Felt how cold nights get n'
How slow time always goes 
When ev'ry night I know
The sun's gonna find the moon n'  
This heartache's gonna bring  me you 
You - my misty Midnight Blue 
You - my misty Midnight Blue
 
V2 
Life's never perfect 
You made it worth it 
Until you left me 
On that cold mornin' 
Now nothin' is workin'  

Ch2 
I've stared at sunsets 
Felt how cold nights get n'
How slow time always goes 
When ev'ry night I know
The sun's gonna find the moon n'  
This heartache's gonna bring  me you 
You - my misty Midnight Blue 
You - my misty Midnight Blue

Br 
Now, here I am all alone  
Singin' to the night ... n' you 
You...you...you 
You...you...you

Plowin' through that crowded school hall n' 
She was blockin' my path 
As I tried to get past  
Shot me a smile then she moved along 
On the bus that ev'nin'  
I was lookin' for a  seat n' 
Once again, stand-in' there 
Those blonde curls - blue eyes -  
Turn-the-world-upside-down with just a simple stare  
I couldn't find the words but I worked up  
The nerves just to say hello 
I was playin' it cool but the cold hard truth  
Was burnin' deep inside my soul 
If by happenstance we ran 
Into each other every single day 
Stay in my way  
I was at the supermarket 
Speedin' through in my cart n' 
She blocked the aisle I needed to go down 
I tried to get it together - should'a known better 
Well, I’m tellin’ this time around 
I couldn't find the words but I worked up  
The nerves just to say hello 
I was playin' it cool but the cold hard truth  
Was burnin' deep inside my soul 
If by happenstance we ran 
Into each other every single day 
Stay in my way  
Next time I saw her 
She gave me her number n' 
I called just to let her know... 
I'm glad I found the words n' the nerve 
To say more than just hello 
I was playin' it cool but this cold hard truth  
Was burnin’ deep inside my soul  
It’s not by chance we ran 
Into each other every single day

Greg",G Putnam (50%) ASCAP Erik Nelson (50%) ASCAP,Americana,ONE STOP - G Putnam Music owns Masters & Publishing Control,QZ-GD6-21-00197,"The foundation for our nation 
Based on pure experimentation 
Expresses ideals of humanity  
Relies on rule by majority 
The right to vote is our lone hope 
To heed the truth our founders wrote 
Leaders should stand where we stand
That’s how we keep things American
Democracy
Guides the Land of Liberty 
You don’t always win, so earn your turn
We have to give n’ take - live n’ learn
…The vote keeps us free  
…Democracy
It’s to those values we need to cling
Should have nothin’ to do with money
A free vote is what makes it work (it’s)
How we ensure our voices our heard
We tell our kids to respect one another
Tell ‘em to be kind n’ share…(there’s)
A diff’rence between what they see n’ hear 
It’s belief versus greed, hate, n’ fear
Democracy
Guides the Land of Liberty 
You don’t always win so earn your turn 
We have to give n’ take - live n’ learn
…The vote keeps us free  
The Constitution lays out how it’s done
Explains government’s for ev’ryone
It don’t mention wealth or races (it)
Separates church n’ state - it embraces
That we’re all equal in th’ eyes of th’ law
Ev’ry vote matters n’ ev’ry vote talks 
That’s what the words say…(hell, it’s)
All in the name…(of)
Democracy…
You don’t always win, so earn your turn
We have to give n’ take - build not burn 
…The vote keeps us free

I’m staring at you though you’re never there
I sit alone talking into the night
To a ghost that’s long since  lost to my life

With each passing hour, times sweet taste is turning sour
My heart drags through, every minute
Cause the night goes so slow without you in it
What am I gonna do with this broken heart
How am I gonna keep my world from falling apart
What’ll I do when all the pieces fall
Where am I gonna hide when my eyes
My eyes tell it all

Every morning the world seem so strange
When I wake up to your smile
Every nightfall the world hasn’t changed
The memories run in circles, no they just won’t reconcile

With each passing hour, times sweet taste is turning sour
My heart drags through, every minute
Cause the night goes so slow without you in it

as men tossed dirt on his grave.
Then she walked a long slow walk home.
She kept hearing his name.
She turns the knob, opens the door 
to a house that feels so alone.
So many years, rainbows and storms.
More than brick built this home.
and she doesn't know where to go.
She's not quite sure what to do.
All of her routines that she used to know,
each one she'll have to create new.
And she'll do it with no one around her.
No one, no one's heart to hold on to.
She steps in, closes the door, looks 
around and stands there still.
Can't move, she can barely breathe, 
feels something she don't know how to feel.
And she doesn't know where to go.
She's not quite sure what to do.
All of her dreams that she used to know,
each one she'll have to create new.
And she'll do it with no one around her.
No one, no one's heart to hold on to.
He was the once in a lifetime, 
together since senior high 
got through tough times.
Always kissed her good night, 
he was part of her thoughts 
without him she feels lost,
trying to find her life.
Trying to heal inside.
and she doesn't know where to go.
She's not quite sure what to do.
All of those answers that she used to know,

I'm sure willing to play.
There's no time to waste,

Walked up to her feeling sure, 
my intentions purely pure.
She asked me if I'm telling her straight.
That's when I smile my smile and say,
Welcome to my life.
Can't ignore, time is short.
I believe every moment brings opportunities to understand.
I'm a man with a simple little life,
living in a crazy big way.
Boss man yells, tells me I'm late, 
ask me what I have to say.
Hey, I waited while the radio played.
I sing, I sing along, 
so what if a few minutes are gone?
Ain't gonna have to close your gates.
That's when I smile my smile and say,
Welcome to my life.
Can't ignore, time is short.
I believe every moment brings opportunities to understand.
I'm a man with a simple little life,

Don't ask for much, no.
Just enough to say,
Sure, live me some good times along this wild path I've paved.

Ev’ry reason’s so timeless - inside the word goodbye

She was movin’ and groovin’ to the music of the cover band 
My heart got off beat when she took me by the hand
She had me driftin’ away like a wave on the dance floor n’ 
The light in her smile carried me back to shore
When she gazed into my eyes, I knew right then
I don’t ever want this song to come to an end

I’m not tryin’ to get in your plans (but)
When I hold ya, pullin’ you in closer feels right to my hands

Should give our hearts a chance

It’s a sin (ooh) If I’m not the one to praise it
I usually am a strong stand-up man (but)
She’s got me fallin’ so deep
If we could, hit rewind or just pause the time n’ 
Play this night on repeat

If all good things must end, well
I just gotta say
Hey girl, how about another dance
Yeah, I’m tryin’ to get in your plans
Coz when I hold ya, pullin’ you in 
Closer feels right to my hands

Playin' in the park alone
Playin' on a toy tractor - diggin' with its shovel
When he'd be late n in trouble
Now he's standing in that park
With the woman who held his heart
Took his time growin' up - wasn't in no kinda rush n'
Romance was a temptin' cliff, he thought he'd slip n'
To him the word forever felt like a push n'
He was afraid he'd someday be ambushed (but)
This time he's not - he's takin' the plunge
'Cause ----- this time --- this time --- this time
This time--it's love
Hearts that don't love, won't get broken (but)
When hope opened up - he closed down (when)
He'd let those 3 words slip, n' say he was jokin' n'
Didn't know how it feels to feel so proud
Took him some time to figure what love's about n'
Now, he's ready to take those vows
Took time growin' up - wasn't in no kinda rush n'
Romance was a temptin' cliff, but thought he'd slip n'
To him the word forever felt like a push n'
He was afraid he'd someday be ambushed (but)
This time he's not - he's takin' the plunge
'Cause ----- this time --- this time --- this time
This time--it's love
He didn't need to see it written in bright lights (no)
Just needed to fall all the way into her eyes n'
For the rest of his life...it's love

I was ready to get up when in steps an old gent
Sat down by me, turned his tired face my way
In a shaky voice softly asked me to stay
He told me about a friend from his childhood
who worked hard, got ahead, set out to do good
Made money then greed, chasing destiny
In his race to the top, there were things he forgot
See if you think money is what it means to succeed
If you'd take a closer look at what life should be
It's kindness, love, being happy, and look at me, now look at me.
If you tell the truth, it truly paves your path
If you tell a lie, have to keep on looking back
If you want to meet that man with selfish dreams, 
Sonny look at me, yeah look at me.
The old man grew a new sadness and regret
A wife took the kids, didn't really care that they left
When he fell ill, so few came to the hospital
Saw how so much money really brought him so little
If you think money is what it means to succeed
If you take a closer look at what life should be
It's kindness, love, being happy, and look at me, now look at me.
If you tell the truth, it truly paves your path
If you tell a lie, have to keep on looking back
If you want to meet that man with selfish dreams, sonny look at me, yeah look at me.
Scooted back in his chair, stood up, said don't be scared
Unless you look in the mirror and see someone like me
Really I've got nobody
No it's not where time went, it's about how it's spent
If we think money is what it means to succeed
If we take a closer look at what life should be
It's kindness, love, being happy and shouldn't that be true for everybody?
If we tell the truth it truly paves our paths
If we tell lies, have to keep looking back
If we don't want to be the ones with selfish dreams, 
Everyone should look at me, yeah look at me
Who do people see when they look at me?
Who do people see when they look at me?
Who do people see when they look at me?

V1
I went out to be alone 'neath the moon n' stars
Sat right where my ev'ry-day-friend & I drank
We'd squat here weekends - close the bars (we'd be)
Laughin' & cacklin' at my bad jokes n' dang
10 months later life threw what I call a final boomerang
A final goodbye - played your last card

I'm stumblin' - crumblin' - my life's been scarred

Tonight feels brisk n' to be honest
The only thing I know it all feels so wrong
Really....truly....cross my heart until dawn
The true forever.....
The real real forever ....
The only forever's that you're gone

V2
A broken heart needs time to heal for real n'
Maybe sometimes in some ways it never will
At a time when it all feels so surreal
Permanence rises high like to the sky - still
I chew my lip so as not to cry - oh why

PreCh2 [optional]
Times roll along - you might get caught off guard
Tragedies don't come light - they draw dark

It was a lesson I shouldn't have listened.
I held on too long, look past the wrong and 
Right to the makeup kisses.
And little by little when the flame

And I thought love was lost until

Warming up under two plush covers on a cool winter sunset.
She had me falling like the autumn leaves.
all that I would need is a little love.

Proof I was searching wasn't in the bourbon,
needed some straw to drown out the burn and 
some kind of healing for my pain 
I couldn't find in the Sunday sermon.

Won’drin’ why your senses turn numb

V1) You may wonder who told me
That you found somebody new
But, when did you last hold me
N’ when did I last see you__
You’re runnin’ with a new heart
No, I don’t understand
You left me without a word
Like a fool -- well, I guess I am__
I walk to the river 
N’ I just sit here
I feel the cold creepin’ in
I hear the whisp’rin’ in the wind

Ch) It wasn’t words from a friend
It wasn’t somethin’ that I saw
There was no announcement
I didn’t get no phone call
In the end, I closed my eyes (n’ then)
I heard that lonesome cry 
Again n’ again…
I hear the whisp’rin’ in the wind
Coda: Can’t get past the whisp’rin’ in the wind

V2) Friends will ask n’ I pretend
I say we just need some time
I walk on n’ they laugh
They know you left me behind__
I have nowhere to go
Walk to the river’s bend
I stare at the water’s flow
Askin’ why it never ends__

Always searchin’ for her way around

She sees things gets too scary
The world’s not her jury…
So slow down – stop the hurry…
Little Miss Worry
She wrinkles her nose as she takes a look around
She never feels safe – afraid to make a sound 
She won’t ever talk loud n’ she’s slow to smile
Oh, she’s so kind – but her heart’s hard to find 
She’s little Miss Worry

V1 
If you wander the woods at midnight on Halloween
and something moves between the trees - rustling leaves
The ground shakes, and you trip on an old tombstone and 
you'll hear a sound that chills you to the bone! 

Ch1 
When the witches wizards and warlocksall romp
The ghosts and the demons and goblins clomp, clom
How they whirl and twirl all night 
I'm saying it's a frightening sight
When they're doing a dance they call
The Cemetery Stomp! 

V2 
Well the trolls 2-step like they're in a trance.
The ghouls shake like there are spiders in their pants
The vampires play the same song on and on (while)
Zombies try to keep up & sing along.

Ch1
His bankbook’s grown full – his time’s in a race
Can’t really feel love but knows it has its place
His heart’s on empty n’ where’s that he’s gettin’?
Greed must be temptin’ but The Gates don’t take gold 
So - it’s like goin’ to church……without a soul

V2
Chasin' fast cash n’ run with fast girls – life's blessed
Don’t care no one’s there – if it's time to cry
He walks the halls some call success 
Carry your weight when it’s your time
In heaven best not try lies - you can't hide

Ch2
His bankbook’s grown full – his time’s in a race
Can’t really feel love but knows it has its place
His heart’s on empty n’ where’s that he’s gettin’?
Greed must be temptin’ but The Gates don’t take gold 
So - it’s like goin’ to church……without a soul

He can fold his hands in prayer 
Without sincerely bein' there
Confused - debonair

Ch3/Outro
His bankbook’s grown full – his time’s in a race

It’s me-my-mine without any rhyme  
Those silent moments holdin’ you so tight 
There were no words, only warmth n’ sight

Till we look back to find its measure

One I wasn't ready to see
But I knew the day would come
She mentioned that you think you found love
Finally met that special someone
Oh
I'm finally learning how to get through the day
Without you helping me along the way
I know you're over and I had to go on
But I didn't think it'd be this quick or strong
Oh when the heart gets it wrong 
Oh when the heart gets it wrong
Looking around this world there's so much anger 
So much violence and trouble
And I've had found the struggle 
So much to juggle
So often I stumble
I'm finally learning how to get through the day 
Without you helping me along the way 
I know you're over and I had to go on 
But I didn't think it'd be this quick or strong 
Oh when the heart gets it wrong
We've seen people in our lives come and go 
Hearts get broken after being so sure so 
Stars get crossed 
Fates get swapped 
And feelings get lost

And push my virtues aside

Greg",Clayton Michael Gunn (100%) ASCAP 462448938,Rap,ONE STOP - G Putnam Music owns Masters & Publishing Control,,"Let me say a few words right here, right now 
Before I forget who I am before I let you down
Cause it's just not easy going to town
On lyrical matter, on musical ground 
See, I was born with this call it a gift or a curse
Riding beats with a keyboard and adding a verse
Sometimes it feels like it's better or worse
But I hope I don't get in your way
Cause shit sometimes hurts
Some days you know it all comes easy
Some days it just don't come
Some days it's an uphill battle 
Some days there's a war to be won
But I hope I don't step on your precious toes 
And I hope I don't get on your precious nose 
Cause this is who I am and this is the way it goes 
This is the way it goes I don't know half the shit I do 
But I'm in this game till the game is through 
So much negativity coming straight from you
But I just don't care,
I got shit to do 
Cause I'm caught in the game,
I'm caught in a war 
You can see the windows,
I've locked all the doors 
I've locked out friends, done this before
Cause you were hating on me, but you ain't no more 
I could just give up, just suit yourself
All my dreams up on the shelf 
Gotta go through the nine to five and live in hell 
But I don't see that happening in my honest self 
See, if one was to go, one was to stay
I've been riding tomorrow in a lonely way 
But at least I don't have me in the fire inside 
That I was just born with that will never die 
It must be so hard to see a dream 
Of a man with drive, is it just obscene?
Someone who ignores the jealousy 
A rolling stone, a man who's free 
Never with a curse, playing till it hurts 
Running with a passion for better or worse 
But you just can't take what to me is at stake 
My own inner convictions to never be fake
I ain't going down to someone else's obsession 
Dipping the flame in my own confession 
I guess I'm the only one who learned my lesson 
That if I would give up, I would just be stressing 
He’s a part of me that you don't understand 
And if I gave up, I'd be losing a hand 
It's a part of what makes up this very man 
And I'll keep on going until the end 
I don't know what half the shit I do 
But I'm in this game till the game is through 
So much negativity coming straight from you 
But I just don't care,
I got shit to do 
Cause I'm caught in the game,
I'm caught in a war 
You can see the windows,
I've locked all the doors 
I've locked out friends, done this before 
Cause you were hating on me, but you ain't no more 
I could just give up to suit yourself 
Put all my dreams up on the shelf 
Gonna go for the 9 to 5 and live and live in hell 
But I don't see that happening in my outer self 
See if one wants to go and one wants to stay 
I'd been riding tomorrow in a lonely way 
But at least I don't have me in the fire inside 
That I was just born with that will never die
I don't know what half the shit I do 
But I'm in this game till the game is through

I did not know if you had felt the same 
Love's a curious thing 
So I stood back and thought of you 
I did not know what I could do 
It's been so long since I had played games 
Love's a curious thing 
Oh there must have been something 
I said To make you think that I had led you 
To believe that I was into you 
Love's a curious thing
Oh you're our bodies close 
And I have had an overdose 
Of the one drug that people call love 
Some things I don't understand 
Well some things just can't be explained 
Love is a curious thing 
Sometimes  I don't understand 
And think I can't live without it 
Till I fall back into love Is a curious thing 
Sometimes I don't understand
And think I can't live without it 
Till I fall back into love Is a curious thing 
Sometimes I don't understand 
And think I can't live without it 
Till I fall back into love Is a curious thing 
Sometimes I don't understand 
And think I can't live without it 
Till I fall back into love 
Till I fall back into love 
Oh it's a curious thing
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh

Do not fear.

If you want to fail,
there's a surefire way.
Just forget your dreams,
push them far away.
What do you want to be one day?
One day.
I don't know.
There's something in the way.
I can see you're a simple man.
You just get by with whatever you can.
Come with me and take my hand.
I'll show you something you'll understand.
See that girl?
She's a powerful singer.
You can see from here she could be a winner.
She's so weighed down thinking about tomorrow.
Before it's arrived,
she's filled with sorrow.
She could go out and stand the street 
With a CD player sound to beat
She has a voice.
She's got a voice.
She's got a voice.
She's got a voice.
She's got a voice.
We have to hear.
But she's still afraid.
She's consumed by fear.
Do not fear.
Do not fear.
Do not fear.
Do not fear.
Do not fear.
Do not fear.
Now we move to the second phase
You know how you could live your days
You have a dream that you believe
All you need to do is just break free
From the chains of fear itself
Use your head, use your mouth 
Push that fear from behind
You must make your sound, now's your time
But you must stand
Rise up, be a stronger man 
You feel this future lies ahead 
You'll always remember when you said
 I won't live with fear no more 
I won't be afraid to close the door 
In front of me lies a path 
And freedom is the ultimate 
Fear will always hold you back 
Fear will always bring you down 
Fear will always crush your dreams into 
So you just remember who you are
You and me be so much better 
So keep me around
And close the door

And it seems to me
That in this world
Along these roads
From dust to pearls
Love is still what's keeping you together
It's time to stand up on your feet
Rise from your grave onto the street
And see the sights and hear the sound
Of this beating heart 
This world spinning round
Your heart is fresh to face the day
To take on whatever comes your way
And through the mist and the shades of grey
There is just one thing that I have to say
It seems to me 
That in this world 
We travel the roads 
From dust to pearls 
But love is still what's keeping you together 
You fought, you fight 
And run your race 
You were kicked around
And you lost your place 
You tasted dirt 
When you hit the ground 
And no one was there
When you looked around
You tried and tried to find your way 
You were in a war
Almost every day 
But threw it all In your wicked race
You have found a way
And you've kept your place 
And there's one thing I know 
Yeah, there's one thing I see 
That never before 
Have I seen you shine so brightly 
Yeah, it seems to me

But I've lived and loved and laughed along the way
I know I've left so many standing in the open
But I don't hold on to all my past mistakes
I left her crying on the sidewalk as my heart broke
And broke a little more with each new step I take
I spoke the truth sometimes when a lie was probably better 
But I'm not one to cling to what is fake 
And when all is said and done 
Through the tears and the fun 
I know I'm not the only one to feel this way
I ain't gonna wish my life away 
I ain't gonna fill my heart with hate
No, I ain't gonna run 
When life's a little tough
I ain't gonna blow my chance and miss 
A life of love, a sweet and a simple kiss
I know that we're all 
Diamonds in the rough 
I've laid awake wondering if I will see tomorrow 
I've been scared that I would miss out on my dreams 
But I know that short are times that are filled with sorrow
And in the night it
ain’t always what it seems 
And when all is said and done 
Through the tears and the fun 
I know I'm not the only one that feels this way 
I ain't gonna wish my life away 
I ain't gonna fill my heart with hate 
No, I ain't gonna run 
When life's a little tough
I ain't gonna blow my chance and miss

Driving through the rain in the middle of the night
Walking down the beach with you side by side
Never felt so good,
never felt so right
Thinking about you with no goals in mind
Missing all those we left behind We're crazy,
we're out of our minds
We've had one hell of a ride
Seeing you standing there tonight
With your drinking hand in the warm moonlight
Girl, you look so beautiful to me
And I started thinking where I would have been 
If not for your love that drew me in 
There's so many pages to our biography 
Like what about the night we met You were so cool
I was so scared 
Each other no more than a mystery 
And here I'm standing at the bar 
Watching you on stage with your dad's guitar 
And I can't believe you're coming home with me
It was then that I pictured candlelight 
Driving through the rain in the middle of the night 
Walking down the beach with you side by side 
Never felt so good, never felt so right 
Thinking about you with no goals in mind 
Missing all those we left behind 
We're crazy, we're out of our minds 
We've had one hell of a ride 
You and I 
Oh baby 
Oh we had one hell of a ride
Oh baby
We had one hell of a ride
You and I
I've let you down so many times
And I know we argue and we fight
But tonight I know you're leaving here with me
We've walked together for all these years
We've seen our battles and conquered our fears
I wish you knew how much you meant to me 
And I'll never forget the look in your eyes 
When you told me all about your life 
Everything you'd ever done or seen 
And I'll never forget the way I was 
When you took my hand and my jacket off 
And the first time you ever said that you loved me 
And it was then that I pictured candlelight 
Driving through the rain in the middle of the night 
Walking down the beach with you side by side
Never felt so good, never felt so right 
Thinking about you with no goals in mind 
Missing all those we left behind 
We're crazy, we're out of our minds 
We've had one hell of a ride

And it was then that I pictured candlelight

I was all alone, you were with your friends,
I saw you standing there
right across the floor
I couldn't help but stare.
oh how I wanted more
So I had to stand
and walk across the room
the way you looked at me
I could tell I wanted you
so you got up,
and met me on the floor
I felt I knew all about you
though we never met before

Greg",Clayton Michael Gunn (100%) ASCAP 462448938,"Pop, Indie",ONE STOP - G Putnam Music owns Masters & Publishing Control,,"Yeah, this is the story of my life.
I don't really know how else to explain it.
So I guess I just gotta, well,
tell the truth.
Here goes.
Everytime that I step out the door
There’s always something there that makes me want more
My insatiable appetite for things that shine,
Clouds my judgement and screws with my mind
I don’t think I’m greedy, I give to the needy
I promise that I’ll love you if you never leave
I’m Fighting everyday with the demons in my head
My next piece of sunshine will be when I’m dead
I try my best to please a brother
I care for my sisters give love to my mother
Though I know deep down not a day goes that the love I receive I will always rely
I get so scared when I’m on my own
When I take one step outside my comfort zone
There’s a world out there I’m so afraid
Sometimes I wake up my beds already made

Sometimes when I get so low and I'm without a friend,
I wish I could go back and I could start again.
Yeah, I believe in God.
It's my right.
There's so many times coming through the night.
I'm being so lucky to have seen the face of the creator of the human race.
But with all that said,
it's a constant fight.
I'm loving every day because I'm scared of every night.
Satan's in my head trying to take me away.
It's a constant battle that I live with every day.
Sometimes I think,
screw my life.
Close the door.
Pickup the knife
But I gotta believe there's another side.
He didn't die in vain.
Jesus gave his life.
Why waste mine?
I must do what I can.
I've gotta do something to be a better man.
I can't go back.
No,
I can't go back.
I can't go back and I can’t start again.
Oh, what a life gotta be this hard for the world.
Why was I dealt this card
Sometimes when I get so low and I'm without a friend,
I wish I could go back and I could start again.
Do I turn left?
Do I turn right?
How can I tell when my goal's not inside?
Do I trust my gut feeling when I'm staring at the ceiling trying to decide which thought to believe in?
I need some guidance.
I need some direction.
Life's a jigsaw puzzle.
Time for a new section 
I need God's love.
I need God's affection.
Make no mistakes.
Attain to perfection.
Will I turn the corner with false ambition?
It's human race,
but it's not a competition.
Sometimes I think I just need to shut up and listen,
So much to see
So many things I'm missing.
I need to change the place.
I need to just slow down.
I need to pray to God to turn things around.
Life is tough.
No denying.
I'd say it's a breeze,
but I would be lying.
Life’s no breeze.
I must confess.
It's full of disappointment and distress.
It's a constant battle.
A constant war.
Yet it keeps you
Wanting more?
A touch of gladness to wipe away your tears.
It's been this way for years.
Yeah.
Oh Lord,
why does life
Gotta be this hard father why was I dealt 
This card
Sometimes when I get so low and I'm without a friend,
I wish I could go back and I could start again.
Oh Lord,
why does life
Gotta be this hard, father why was I 
Dealt this card
Sometimes when I get so low and I'm without a friend,
I wish I could go back and I could start again.
Well, it's my life.
It's what I live with.
Every day.
Day in the life.

My naive self never knew
That at times you must have worried
About the things you saw me do
Now I hope you can forgive me
I know I bought about a war
We battled daily with our heartache
An end like this we never saw 
Because life's too short for hatred 
We were only us for a while
Then an earthquake had to shake it
And now we’re rising from the pile
It must have hurt you 
Like I know it hurt me 
What comes tomorrow I cannot see
Though in the distance
You'll think of me 
And I of you 
And we'll be free 
And we'll be free
You may not understand my reasons 
I didn't either at the time 
I thought my world had been completed 
Though we were set apart by fire 
A mystery remains within us 
That solid ground we could not find
Now as we're sifting through the ashes 
I hope you find yours 
And I hope I find mine

One in a billion and I'm existing
Shot off like a shooting star
Now I'm left to face this mountain wishing
Open heart, open mind 
Searching for a higher heaven
Left behind what I thought I was
Ego crushing, left unending
Searching for a better me
Strong desire to just be free
Looking for a joy unending 
Good with bad these days 
I'm mending truth be told 
I'm floating through 
What I thought was me I tell the truth 
Let my good heart guide me through 
On my way back home to you 
Left behind, lost somewhere
Will I ever see you again 
I can see the day you walked away 
I really wish that you had stayed 
Maybe things will one day heal 
Maybe I can make a stronger appeal
At the time it was such a thrill 
But I always tried to keep it real 
Searching for a better me
Strong desire to just be free 
Looking  for a joy unending 
Good with bad these days 
I'm mending Truth be told 
I'm floating through 
What I thought was me I tell the truth
Let my good heart guide me through 
On my way back home to you
And in my wildest dreams
Would I ever think
That I couldn’t float
Though I began to sink
And it wasn’t until 
I had to pull myself through
That I started to realise 
The solid truth
Open hearts and open minds
Lead to honest love most the time
Will I float away in a sea with you
If it was you I could run through 
Well it’s back
This black desire 
That burning hot fire
The testing, the trials 
The unending spiral 
That I must climb 
Mountain made low 
Raise this valley up 
So that I can show 
What I have inside 
What I need to see 
To stop me from falling 
So I can just be 
A man with a purpose 
A guy with a dream 
A rock solid aliby 
Alibi remains to be seen 
Searching for a better me 
Strong desire to just be free

Stood myself up and started walking around
Promised myself I'd climb past you
And do all the things I said I was going to
I've reminded my heart to forget 
And just when that's where it's gonna get
I hear a song drive past a place 
And it's fresh smoke from a smoldering flame
Cause when I think I'm safe again 
Your memory blazes in 
And it hits me so hard
It knocks me back where I started
Burned and brokenhearted
It's alright that I can go somewhere tonight And yes,
I'll do just fine
Until I go outside and open my eyes 
Cause when I think I'm safe again 
Your memory blazes in
And it hits me so hard
It knocks me back where I started
Burned and brokenhearted 
I promised myself I'll do better 
Not sure where I am 
Not sure how I got here 
Rose from ashes, dusted off 
So I can go on 
Another life, another time
Need to be somewhere I can't seem to find
Cause when I think I'm safe again 
Your memory blazes in 
And it hits me so hard 
It knocks me back where I started

Time I can wake to you again

It sparks a little fire 
A bit of  warmth and comfort 
And a large dose of desire 
A heart like yours is real girl

And I don't know where this is going

And so I glance back at it when I get the chance to see
But who doesn't know I wasn't far behind
Mind you, was doing my work like soap and crimes
And I heard something sounded like a talk 
Which surely followed a tick from that wall clock 
Time for me to get soap, I swear
Maybe I need to crawl out from my shell 
Lower my big boy and raise a little hell 
Free hits and loose ends
Cold kiss and tell 
Well, I'll need a weekend But going out the deep end 
When the going gets toughed 
The tough get gone 
Whenever waters get rough 
I'll be rowing 
When someone forgets or trips a problem arises 
I get it fixed,
I started almost hating surprises
Everyday has them if you open your eyes 
And that's what I'm trying 
So you're buying 
Maybe I need to crawl out from my shell 
Lower my big boy and raise a little hell
Well, I'll need a weekend

Nice to feel happy again But obviously 
All good things must come to an end 
So let the end justify the means

And I tell you that I do because of you
Our senses questions before I ask
Promises me all forever has like
Seven seas will last,
whatever life casts In a desert or a flood,
holding you's all I ever want 
You nourish my soul, how ocean waves roll

Oh, times been told, behold 
What it's been and what it means 
For you to love me 
We can go by land, water, or air
Where we'll see what we wanna see
Some call it a fool's foolish dream
Maybe that's all I can be 
That floats the boat for you and me 
Chasing, embracing, unlacing 
Loving the love we're making 
You nourish my soul, how ocean waves roll

Warm sweet eyes,
big open smile.
So much going in,
no words coming out.
Oh, for the thoughts of a child just starting
to learn about learning life.
Well, she grew up strong
and her hair grew long.
High school dance,
teenage romance.
So much going on,
those words flying out.
Does she know or just pretend her past's full of bumps
and bends?
Because she's learning life day and night.
Just learning life,
wrongs and rights.
Sometimes happy,
sometimes sadder.
When does it count?
When don't it matter?
That's a promise of time.
It's all about learning life.
Learning life.
Learning life.
Learning life.
She's a mother now.
Grew up somehow.
Has a job and a house.
Knows what life's about.
Less about success.
More about what's next.
It's finding when to be quiet,
when to holler loud.
Knowing things tend to work out.
That's learning life.

wrongs and rights.
Sometimes happy,
sometimes sadder.
When does it count?
When don't it matter?

It's what your actions explain.
It's making time to work and taking time to play.
It's about the choices in life.
Cause there ain't no going back.
It's about the times you have.

I've got no friends out here 
Because I've been in awful friend 
Putting myself before others
Not thinking about each other 
I'm the only one out here

Unless I'm making fun of them

White waves, a quick current, seems foreboding
We can keep staring at ongoing or look past
Hold back, holding back, steps follow, hoping 
At last

Can't get there, can't get there if we're not clear eyed
Can't get there, can't get there, can't get there if we don't try

Cuz that whiskey dictates my game way too much

They say hard work pays off so here I am paying my dues

thought he'd talk a little more about a bit of a raise

He dressed me down in a ten minute sentence
I stood calm and quiet as my attention left
He asked if I cared.

At least let me watch you leave
Cause my heart's slowly breaking
The further you are from me
I thought we were forever
I thought our love would last
Now I sit here broken
With memories of the past
And why does it have to hurt like this?
And why do hearts have to be broken?
I tried to say I'm sorry
Tried to show I cared
Didn't mean to hurt you
To see you crying there
But it seems we've gone too far this time
And we just cannot return
Well I guess that we tried all we can
But bridges still get burned
And why does it have to hurt like this?
And why do hearts have to be broken?
Oh we tried ever since our first kiss
Sometimes I guess love can be broken

Why did you have to hurt me for?
No more to say, no games to play, why did you have to play me for?
If you want to hurt me just wait.
Wait and see, every little thing that you've done to me
Some of the things I just can't believe
Telling lies look at me in the eyes
Walked out the door 'cause you could not disguise who you were
Who you are, a liar, a cheater, a parasite
It came to the stage that I walked away
No more to do, no more to say
But your pride took a dive so low
Who could hurt you beautiful?
Well look in the mirror and you might find
All the reasons I left you behind
To think about it it's plain to see
The only one ever hurting was me
Why did you have to hurt me for?
I don't understand, it came to the end and I was walking out the door
Why did you have to hurt me for?
No more to say, no games to play, and I was walking out the door.
You turned it on, you became someone I just could not understand
You beat the system, played the victim, you lied through your teeth to get me back again
We made mistakes, this I know, but the biggest I made was trusting you
To open up, share my soul, I thought it was something beautiful
But you were cold, you had no end, I know you tried to understand
But you're so precious, self-absorbed, you lost me 'cause you could not afford
To be the good one, to share your heart
A closed book, I should have seen from the start
You led me on, lied to me, and now you're trying to destroy me
Oh, why did you have to hurt me for?
No more to say, no games to play, and I was walking out the door
I've lost my faith, give up the race, tried to smile as you spat in my face
Lost my peace, my happiness, I had nothing to confess
Why did you have to hurt me for?
I've lost my faith, give up the race, tried to smile as you spat in my face
Lost my peace, my happiness, I had nothing to confess
But if you feel like you hurt me, just close your eyes and you will see

I don't understand, it came to the end and I was walking out the door

I gave you my world, you tore it all apart
I'm still trying, trying to do what I can
But there's just a shadow where once stood a man
I look up to the sky, hear myself asking why
I can't find love and I can't find you tonight
You keep running through my head, should be in my arms instead
I keep making my way through this hell
Looking for an angel, angel, I'm looking for an angel
I hear folks talking,
say I've lost control
Wherever I go, it feels so damn cold
I rise with the sun, no matter what might come
I'm still sifting through the ashes of the damage done
I look up to the sky, hear myself asking why
I can't find love and I can't find you tonight
You keep running through my head, should be in my arms instead
I keep making my way through this hell
Looking for an angel, angel, I'm looking for an angel
I'm giving it my best, the reward will be worth the test
When my search ends, I know I'm gonna be blessed
I'm such a simple, simple man
Can you take me, take me for who I am

You can feel you shine, you feel you glow
There's so much behind you to try and steal your grace

Do I think too much
need less to say
May I speak my mind

I find it hard
to live like that
And when I'm lonely
And all the water's swept away
I'm still scared of my thoughts
that lead to words I have to say
Do I fall in love
well it's too late
On the other side
of love there's hate
And I never want to flip that coin and see
and think of ways love could backfire on me
So I'll stand and give my all
I give my heart, my rise and fall
my everything, my all in all
I give my life, to heart and mind in every way that I can find
Do I give my heart, my second best?
Do I let myself settle for less?
Do I hold my hands up to the sky?

such a distant look in your eye
Like you saw some new tomorrow
Were your eyes up in the clouds
separating somedays from the nows
Repaying what yesterday borrowed
Now you're on your way to San Antone, 
say you wanna start up new
You found a place with pure blue skies and 
that you have a friend or two
Well girl I never knew, I never knew,
 I never knew, I never knew, never knew you
Looking through a rear view mirror
makes it hard to see the tears
I wonder if you even tried
I saw your taillights heading west
to find a place where your sun sets
I watched you drive into the night
Now you're on your way to San Antone, 
to say you want to start up new
Found a place with pure blue skies, and 
that you have a friend or two
Well girl I never knew, I never knew,

I know I promised you that I'd change
that I'd find a way to relight the flame
Well maybe I didn't come through,

But baby, neither did you

I could not see it
I lost it all
I could not break through
Your city walls
My heart was missing
My heart on the floor
I guess those days
Gone out the door

Everyday I do nothing, just getting through
Every evening I go home, hoping something's new
Every night I watch the same old sky, still don't have a clue
Can't get you out of my heart, can't get you out of my dreams
I've searched on every star, crawled up every moonbeam
Don't understand this pain, sure don't know what love means
since you left me, oh, so casually
Every thought turns to memories about you and I
Every question finds no answer except the lonely night
Any answer so far away behind a million whys
Every reason so timeless inside the word goodbye
Can't get you out of my heart, can't get you out of my dreams
I've searched on every star, crawled up every moonbeam
Don't understand this pain, sure don't know what love means
since you left me, oh, so casually
You act like nothing's wrong, ignore everything we've done
I come close, you turn away, like you don't even know my name
It's alright, it's alright, it was all one big lie
Can't get you out of my heart, can't get you out of my dreams
I've searched on every star, crawled up every moonbeam
Don't understand this pain, sure don't know what love means
since you left me, oh, so casually
Oh, so casually

Well I know who I was and I know who I am, I know where I've been, I know where I stand.
I've separated right from wrong and I know which side I'm coming from.
I know how many times I've tried to stand up for myself and do what's right.
To leave the house, explore outside, a big wide world, don't have to hide.
And I know each step I take becomes a chance to make or break.

When you fall to the floor in misery, when you get pushed to the ground.
Sometimes it seems like you're alone and no help can be found.

Sat right where my everyday friend and I drank
We'd squad here weekends, close the bars
We'd be laughing and cackling at bad jokes and dang.
Ten months later life threw a final boomerang
Final goodbye, played your last card
When you left, wasn't quick, hit me real hard
Now I'm stumbling, crumbling, my life's been scarred
Now your memory trapped in time, and I'd be lying to say I'm fine.
I'm trying to grasp how tomorrow's a frail promise
In tonight's risk, and to be honest all I know is
It all feels so wrong
Really, truly cross my heart now 'til dawn
One true forever, one really real forever
The only forevers that you're gone.
A broken heart needs time to heal for real
And maybe sometimes in some ways it never will
At a time when it all feels so surreal
Permanence rises high as the sky is still
I chew my lip so as not to cry, oh why
Time rolls along, you might get caught off guard
Tragedies don't come light, they draw dark
Now your memory trapped in time, and I'd be lying to say I'm fine.
I'm trying to grasp how tomorrow's a frail promise
In tonight's risk, and to be honest all I know is

I still want a man in chaps, but for now my life's my rig.

But listen here, I'm truly blessed.
Rolling along, strong and free, with the radio on, the road's for me.
When I climb from the cab, men say I'm pretty from East LA to New York City.
Drive every bit as good as a man.
I beg to differ if you think I can't. My brothers will tell you
just who I am.
From now on, just call me Sam.

I like real long hauls.
Got me a sexy drawl.

Show me places his life found
told me how my life has meaning
to consider what is bringing.
Said go out and have some fun
share some warmth with everyone.
Told me sometimes you got to get tough
on yourself and never give up.
You got to stand tall, give it your all.
Do your best and don't settle for less.
Ride the tiger, reach even higher.
But remember this, life's just a test.
We drive by the old courthouse where he'd like to turn south.
Drive past the elevator said, ""Hey town, I'll see you later.""
Grandpa would hit the gas, said son, don't ever look back.
Make sure what you're doing's right so you can look 'em in the eye.
You got to stand tall, give it your all.
Do your best and don't settle for less.
Ride the tiger, reach even higher.
But remember this, life's just a test.
Now he's gone, I'm still singing my songs like he taught me to.
He'll always be here with me, in my heart, my memory, he's a part of me.

smokey mountains, grand ole opry

boots and blue jeans

Did you tell her it's forever when you only want right now?

For a moment in time
Wishing I had the answers
Had the perfect lines
But I'm reminded of what I am
A shell of what I used to be
Even though it may never happen
I long to be set free
Free from a mind that weighs a million tons
Constantly reminded of what I've done
For a moment I saw the future and I had won
The war that rages inside
The war that rages inside
The war that rages inside
That night I lost a part of me
That I had took for granted
I always thought I would believe
In happily ever afters
You struck me with a wound
That cut my soul so deep
I'd spend years trying to find my way
While the ones that love me weep
So how come I have to live this way
What I picture in my youth and what I'm living today

It’s half past ten in the AM
And I’m feeling kinda like this is not my jam
Lay on my bed put on my cans
I’m just trying to do whatever I can
To get out of this down
Get out of this low
I’d go somewhere but there’s nowhere to go
I’ll wait it out to see where it goes
Maybe I’ll feel better by tomorrow

Oh my God how much longer is this gonna take
Take take take take take take
I been feeling like this since I was first awake
Wake wake wake wake wake wake wake wake wake
Yesterday I had the whole damn world at my feet
Feet feet feet feet feet feet
But today I’m just trying not to get drowned in defeat
Defeat defeat defeat defeat

Well that’s it I have decided that I’m not gonna spend today divided
Even if that means I gotta change some things
My hair my look my everything well
Maybe I might stay this way
Cause on every other given day I don’t do too bad 
Kinda like this way thinking I might stay
I ain’t gonna change

about how money's paraded
Like nothing else matters
Like every hand has aces
and every heart is gracious
Surely something matters
Take the time to go to the water and watch the waves rolling in
Maybe it's the motion of the ocean as it softly rolls in
Pulse heading inside out, the sea rumbles loud
like it's time to look out
We've forgotten what life's about
Old Ben could barely walk for groceries that he couldn't afford
And check out girl barely smiles at him
A single mom with three kids, forced to work double shifts
Has it really come to this?
Take the time to go to the water and watch the waves rolling in
Maybe it's the motion of the ocean as it softly settles in
Pulse heading inside out, the sea, it rumbles loud
like it's time to watch out
We've forgotten what love's about
There's so much worth in the world in its silence and say
And what would the good Lord say about it?
What do you say for poverty, for kids?
Don't we gotta do more than this?
I wanna go to the ocean and watch the waves rolling in
Maybe it's the motion of the ocean that slowly settles in
Pulls my insides out and the sea grumbles loud
I just want to shout, 'Oh my, oh me, what do I see?'

then I knew I'm seeing things right
Its light showed me how I'm lucky
to have known how you loved me
See stars twinkle, love seemed simple but 
what can stop lost love's ripple
affecting my world, yeah
You were it girl, where are you now?
Went somewhere somehow
And I find I'm lost and alone
with feelings I've never known
hopelessly lost
figuring how
Tell me babe, where are you now?
Watched dark clouds blow by, I cried
that was this morning, stared at the sky
stood right where I was and it found wrong
Remember when I felt so darn strong
images of you pound me like stones
one's thrown through my soul, left me forgotten
hitting bottom, feel rotten
Where are you now?
Went somewhere somehow
And I find I'm lost and alone

V1 
I’ve been lookin’ all ‘round – like a bass lookin’ for bait
So much here looks n’ feels so much the same
See the town square n’ the fam’ly-run cafe
Two bars, one church, n’ roads leadin’ a--way
Come tonight only thing my eyes wanna see…is you
Together we’ll be alone 
I know exactly what we’ll do 

Ch1 
Let’s find a cornfield, honey, I'll kiss you between the ears
Won’t nobody see us ‘cept maybe ole John Deere
Let’s take my pickup to a field down yonder–harvest some beers
Let’s find a cornfield, honey, … n’
I'll kiss you between the ears

V2 
Let’s cruise ‘long a dirt road – drive by starlight 
The only things I need are you n’ me n’ some time
A smilin’ moon is risin’ n’ my temp’rature’s right behind
We’ll find some dirt tracks to some hidden hillside
 tonight the only thing my eyes wanna see is you (baby)
Let's turn off our phones
Turn on some country radio

Ch2 
Let’s find a cornfield, honey, I'll kiss you between the ears
Won’t nobody see us ‘cept maybe ole John Deere
Let’s take my pickup to a field down yonder–harvest some beers
Let’s find a cornfield, honey, … n’
I'll kiss you between the ears

Br 
Make some toasts - chase away any ghosts 
Slip be—tw-een -- the rows n’
Sew some wild oats

Thanks for listening! 

This sensational musical piece typifies amazing creativity, which is flush in his music. His creativity can't be imagined.

NEITHER CAN HIS EXTREME PAIN & LIMITED MOBILITY. Might be the kindest person I've known, well among them/ He's as genuine as people come. 

HE NEEDS HELP! 

Any royalties received by G Putnam Music, formerly G Putnam Music goes to a medical fund by G Putnam Music, LLC. NO Admin charges. 

All $$ go to his fund set to support little things like food, utilities, medical support, transportation, clothing, school supplies, & so on.for 3 wonderful young kids, the youngest being 3. Wife lost job due to recent events. Great worker now drives an hour each way to work on clear roads at non-rush hour times. 

Too proud to ask. He & they all are humble. 

Will remain transparent throughout, & signed off by Michael, who has NO idea I'm doing this.  We live under an hour apart. Frankly, needs a sponsor. He may have flair for the genius at times in his creative space. Imagine if he could just do music. Would be unbelievable! .

Layin' in the hay

I remember that 1st touch
Your hand held mine n’
When you smiled – I felt such a rush
A tingle climbed up my spine
You opened my door, walked my floor
Knew right then I wanted more

Ch1
You had me believin’
You stared into my eyes - I blushed
You had me wonderin’
What was ahead for us
We sat around talkin’ ‘bout the comin’ year
Dreamed about what we’d become
Mentioned forever, told me it’s love (baby)
Had me believin’

V2
Must’a been weak for a moment
Let my defenses down
Guess I left my better sense
For feelin’s that turned me around
I fell under a spell too strong
Like magic - you were gone

Ch2
You had me believin’
You stared into my eyes - I blushed
You had me wonderin’
What was ahead for us
We sat around talkin’ ‘bout the comin’ year
Dreamed about what we’d become
Mentioned forever, told me it’s love

Br
Ev’ry step seemed so right
Ev’ry breath reached deep inside
Then you felt some fear n’
That’s why you’re not here
…You had me believin’…oh…no

Ch3
I had me believin’
I stared into your eyes – I blushed
I had me wonderin’

Got a flat tire – thought you’d  save the day
Dialed your number – askin' you to come here
Said, hey, hey, there’s a life to save
Told me no way – boys were headin’ to your place n’
You had to be sure the keg was ready to pour
You told me I’d just have to wait ('Coz)

It’s all about you - all you do
To me you’re a hug that don’t squeeze
A bad memory that won’t leave
You sit there forgettin’ “we” means two

Go get a clue

V2 
Friend came along n’ took me on home
If I had a magic wand, I’d melt your ice gone
You’d cry, hey, hey, my beer is too warm
You talk real big hangin’ with friends you dig
Have boy’s toys to play – ones that give
Delusion -- Won’t make you rich (c’mon)

Br 
One night you told me ‘bout a dream
When your ship finally came in
Went into detail – ev’ry scene
You thanked all n’ 
As I clearly recall
Said lots of things
Mentioned your old dog, Jake (but)
You never even said my name (oh, yeah)

Verse 1
The doctor came n’ told me – you were gone
Touched my arm – said you left quietly n’ strong
Hearin’ a stranger say your name in that way
Knowin’ what followed would bring such pain
In an instant fog - I tried to ask
If I could see you, but my voice cracked
My heart, my belief, my truth all died
Baby girl, they went with you - really - so did I

Chorus1
No one else has your voice, your face
How you always kind’a went your own way
You had the spirit of a wild horse
I hear it in the chorus (when)
The wind sings to the trees
Listen with me 
Sounds like your ride to your right restin’ place 
…You’ll be okay (2x)

Verse 2
All alone -- I move through crowds 
Even though I wanna stop n’ cry out loud
I know you made it, when I hear the wind howl 
You wanted peace n’ it tells me that’s what you found

Chorus2
No one else has your voice, your face
How you always kind’a went your own way
You had the spirit of a wild horse
I hear it in the chorus (when)
The wind sings to the trees
Listen with me 
Sounds like your ride to your right restin’ place 
…I’ll be okay (2x)

Bridge
No one ever knew what it was like to be you
No one ever knew what it was like to be you
No one ever knew what it was like to be you, no
No one ever knew what it was like to be you, no
No one ever knew I was just like you…but I do

Chorus3
No one else has your eyes, your smile
How you always felt so, so damn wild
Had the spirit of a race horse
I hear it in the chorus (when)
The wind serenades the trees
Listen with me 
Sounds like your ride to your right restin’ place 
…We’ll be okay (3x)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,mp3,2025-11-06 16:36:56.452208+00:00,https://l2-disco-data-us.s3.amazonaws.com/media/trackfiles/e5f373ce-5f86-4be3-8832-4adf3164f60a.mp3?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22175181520.mp3%22&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIARBQWSWOVHNCCOKFH&Signature=xkOz%2FJlTFOYWnik7gXY8kJHIPw4%3D&Expires=1767994983,0:04:36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Don't you know -- that it's time -- for a clean sweep  

V1
I've been walkin' around so quietly
Dishes, dustin', doin' laundry
Stay out'a your way while you play your games
Endless cookin' - cleanin' -oh, I need a break
It's like there's no one to help me out
When you're home, you're glued to the couch
You're married more to the tv than to me
Spider webs a' growin' at your feet 
	   
Ch1
Well, my love's a little dusty
Too many corners piled too deep
Truth can't hide beneath a rug 
The promise is too hard to keep
Time to start anew -- time to take one from two
Don't you know -- that it's time -- for a clean sweep  
	   
V2
Now, it's truly starting to feel cold 
When you give me your hand to hold
But, those time's -- are so rare
You walk ahead -- like I'm not there
We'll be better off  -- this ain't love 
I follow you -- playin' pick up
Let's take the writin' off the wall
Just let all those mem'ries fall 

Ch2
Well, my love's a little dusty
Too many corners piled too deep
Truth can't hide beneath a rug 
The promise is too hard to keep
Time to start anew -- time to take one from two
Don't you know -- that it's time -- for a clean sweep  
	   
Br
Goodbye can't be a surprise
You've told so many lies
Think you're good at that 
I can only laugh (ha!) 
Guess you've always been this way 
Back then you had a dif'rent face
There's only one thing left to say 
That's goodbye to this mess we made 

Ch4
Well, my love's a little dusty
Too many corners piled too deep
Truth can't hide beneath a rug 
The promise is too hard to keep
Time to start anew -- time to take one from two

V1 
I hear you sneak in through the back door
Out late again - I wonder what for
You tell me stories I can see right through
Then you shut me down when I question you
Oh, I’ve been tough but each time somethin's lost n’
I’m finding that I’ve had enough

Ch 
A woman knows love’s slow rush
That inner trust – that gentle touch
A woman knows somethin’s wrong
When the feelin's gone
Love grows cold
A woman knows…a woman knows

V2 
You hear my voice n’ not my words 
Don't listen for meaning but that’s not the worst
It’s twistin’ truth - a strange scent
It’s never asking me where I went
You look so empty – so full of indifference
Do you even care what happens to us
 
Ch 
A woman knows love’s slow rush
That inner trust – that gentle touch
A woman knows somethin’s wrong
When the feelin's gone
Love grows cold
A woman knows…

Br 
I turn out the lights n’ 
Close my eyes
I feel so alone 
Just me n’ your lies
Then I stare out the window
At the silent night
Starlight - star bright
Clear as your shine
It’s time for goodbye 
(Oh Yeah)

Ch 3
A woman knows…a woman knows
That inner trust – that gentle touch
A woman knows something’s wrong
When the feelin's gone
When love has grown cold
It’s time to move on
Time to let go
A woman knows…a woman knows
Deep in her soul
A woman knows",,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,mp3,2025-11-06 16:57:56.321620+00:00,https://l2-disco-data-us.s3.amazonaws.com/media/trackfiles/e2c74d40-1ec5-4d2d-a7d7-ae9b837b2c5c.mp3?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22175183483.mp3%22&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIARBQWSWOVHNCCOKFH&Signature=sJmokLxzF4pzCeHxeUzFIK0q9G8%3D&Expires=1767994983,0:04:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wondered, where does it go? (well)
It goes on - grows on ... someone else 
People let go...fast or slow - too hot - too cold
Who knows? Who knows? 
They may have too tight a hold
Or not enough n' let go
One thing you can count on, friend
Love leaves but it doesn't end
I'll be straight...it waits
It migrates
To new...
Just like you
 
Too new
Just like you
Had to
Just like you
Can-do
Just like you
Breakthrough
Just like you
Make due
Just like you
Just like you
 
We move on - groove on ... somewhere else 
Days let go...years take hold n' it feels old
Who froze? Who grows? 
You may have too tight a grip
Or not enough - can let go
One thing you can count on, friend
Love leaves but it doesn't end
I'll be straight...it waits
It migrates to new

The way you blew me off
Without a second thought
You just walked your walk
Right past all I thought
Means somethin’ to you
Is any of this true?
 

Now that I’m gone
I’m not your worry
You made some choices (ow)
Made 'em in a hurry (so)
Take a look now
On your way down
…Just remember me
...Just remember how
 

(You'll) only go so far
Till you’ll see who you are
How you come across
Standin’ there, you'll look so lost (but)
Truth is gonna catch you 
The day that I forget you
 

Now that I’m gone
I’m not your worry
You made some choices (ow)
Made 'em in a hurry (so)
Take a look now
On your way down
…Just remember me
...Just remember how
 

You’ll stand in a room
Alone with a sad truth
No one to talk to
See, ev’rybody knew
Ahh
See everybody knew
Just what this would come too
Yeah yeah
 
And Now that I’m gone
I’m not your worry
You made some choices (ow)
Made 'em in a hurry (so)
Take a look now
On your way down
…Just remember me
...Just remember how
Now...dear....now..
As time is true......
I'm gonna forget 
I’m gonna forget you
Mmm. Oh yeah
